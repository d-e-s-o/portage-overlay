Subject: [PATCH] Allow sourcing of current config file from folder-hook

Commit eb48fd1368b5 ("Allow `source` in hooks to point to relative
paths") broke setups which source the "current" configuration file from
a folder-hook: there are now reports about "Cyclic sourcing" of said
configuration. Folder hooks are deferred, so there is nothing wrong with
that.
Remove cycle detection logic altogether.
